### Dendritic Neural Networks


#### About
This repo contains the code and data required to replicate our work on dendritic-tree neural networks. We were inspired by the input dendrites of biological neurons, which recent neuroscience research has revealed to contain complex, non-linear computations.

#### Code and Reproducibility
You can find the PyTorch implementation for a dendritic layer under `src/DendriticLayer.py`, or full classifiers using these layers under `src/Classifiers.py`.   Alternatively, you can use the experimental setup linked below for updated training and evaluation loops.
